# Amazon Affiliate Marketing Team

This repo runs two parallel marketing channels:

| Channel | Directories | Purpose |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Wellthlab DTC | `posts/`, `products/`, `content/week-*` | Shopify social + email |
| Amazon Affiliate | `affiliate/`, `site/`, `content/affiliate/` | SEO landing pages + Associates |

Do not mix Shopify product URLs into affiliate pages unless explicitly cross-promoting.

## Start here

For full pipelines, use the **amazon-affiliate-orchestrator** skill.

Trigger phrases:
- "Launch affiliate page for {topic}"
- "Run full affiliate workflow"
- "Amazon affiliate team"

## Workflows

| Say in chat | Workflow file |
|-------------|---------------|
| "Run affiliate product research" | `workflows/affiliate-product-research.md` |
| "Build affiliate landing page for {topic}" | `workflows/affiliate-landing-page.md` |
| "Publish affiliate page" | `workflows/affiliate-publish-checklist.md` |
| "Run affiliate weekly content" | `workflows/affiliate-weekly-content.md` |

## Commands

```bat
run affiliate-link B0XXXXXX   REM build one affiliate URL
run affiliate-link --all      REM build all ASIN links
run affiliate-validate        REM compliance + SEO checks
run affiliate-dev             REM Astro dev server
run affiliate-build           REM production build
```

## Compliance gate

No page ships without:
1. `amazon-compliance` skill checklist passed
2. `python scripts/validate_affiliate_page.py` exits 0
3. `published: true` in frontmatter only after both pass
